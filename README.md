## About the project
Given the data about patient's vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, bodyweight, height, etc.), cc (their symptoms), and other relevant medical information, the resulting PDx (medical code) indicates the medical billing.
In this project, the goal is to predict the medical result of the patient according to the features given (aka. <b> Supervised Learning</b>) based on several features combinations.
